Recently I have an issue and need to investigate it on Windows Server. So I decided to try to install [Windows Server 2012](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012-r2) using [virtualbox](http://www.vbox.me/).

> Get the [KMS client setup keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys#windows-server-2012-r2)

### Let's set things up

The most easiest step - setup, yes. I installed the VirtualBox, set things up like Storage (pick the correct iso file), RAM, Disk, etc.

After that I tried to start the Windows setup
