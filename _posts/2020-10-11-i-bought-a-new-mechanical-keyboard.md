> Just a show off post!

Since the covid-19 started and I worked from home, I started to practice touch typing. Actually, the reason behind that was I wanted to use [vim](https://oclockvn.github.io/2020/06/05/faster-coding-with-vim.html), till now I've been using vim a lot.

I feel really excited when I use vim better day by day, but then I faced an issue, that was my fingers start to hurt. You know, when you use all your fingers to typing, especially for the developer, your pinky hurts so badly since you use the characters like (),./;'[]{} plenty of times, basically almost the keys in the right side. And I still used the cheap keyboard 200k.

So I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard, it's **Durgod V87** Red Switch (i better bought a Blue Switch to annoy everybody in the office LOL), but the Red one is fine. You know when you use the mechanical keyboard a while and get back to the "rice engine" keyboard, it feels like you hit into rocks, so hard and so hurt.

Here's some advice for you:
- It's worth it to buy a mechanical keyboard. The keyboard is the thing you use almost all the time at work, and its price does not matter compare to your entire working time and the money you got.
- Read about the Switch carefully before choosing, the Blue Switch might sound fun but annoy everyone around you, Red Switch makes no sound but maybe boring you. Brown Switch is in the middle. All depend on you.
- If you don't have experience in the mechanical keyboard, you should go and take a try at the store, and ask someone to go with you. If you're a developer, consider keyboards with number and function keys separately, the position of the arrow keys may do matter with your typing type.
- Last but not least, the right number keys might not important for you, so consider a keyboard without it.

So far I'm pretty happy with it, no more pain, and I can focus on creating bugs LOL.
